### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was one of my favorite labs to complete because it was my first experience of having a user input entered into a program. This opened my eyes to the beginning of what I could accomplish in Computer Science. With this lab, I began to think of other ways I could obtain a User's input and use it. 

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was also one of my favorite labs to complete because I learned how to write code that could assist in computational tasks. I also learned how to take multiple pieces of data and implement it through a function. This lab helped me understand the evaluating abilities a computer possesses with difficult numbers. 

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was another one of my favorites because I learned how to incorporate multiple files into a program. By having seperate files, it not only appears easier to understand, but also allows multiple people to work on seperate files simultaneously. I learned how to build on different functions so the entierty of the code could produce a functioning program.
